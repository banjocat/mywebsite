<p>Hello. My name is Jack. I am full stack web engineer at Commscope.</p>
<h2>My Stack</h2>
<h4>Linux</h4>
I love Linux. I have no issue with Windows or Macs I just been using Linux
for so long that I can't imagine using or working with anything else.
<h4>C++</h4>
When speed is needed there is C++. I have coded in modern C++14 style or C
with classes that is popular in the embedded world. 
I prefer the modern approach if given the option.
<h4>JavaScript</h4>
For frontend I like JQuery. The 
benefit of not having to deal with as many browser incompatability surprises
is too good to pass up. I frequently have to support older IE versions.
I am really exctied about webcomponents.
I have experience using react.js and backbone. I also have done some work
using nodejs for fast prototyping.
<h4>Python</h4>
Not the fastest language but when you want to get things done it is hard to beat.
Development time is much quicker with the large library support and clean syntax.
It is my prefered backend language.  You always can go to C++ or consider using PyPy if
speed is important. 
<h4>SQL</h4>
I can write any query needed but ORMs are superior. If you try to change your database
and you are using straight SQL it becomes a nightmare quick. Of course.. ORMs aren't perfect.
That is the plight of programming choices. Everything has tradeoffs.
<h4>Others</h4>
I try to be language agnostic but choices have to be made.
I toy with other languages as well such as Go, Lisp, and Ruby. 
I am a fan of NoSQL but I haven't worked on a serious project that used it yet.
I believe inm icroservices. A monolthic design can produce
faster code but they seem to always turn into a spaghetti mess. Breaking things
up will make some reduncies but it makes analyzing the entire project easier.

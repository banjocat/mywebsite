<p>Hello. My name is Jack. I am a full stack web engineer at Commscope.</p>
<h2>My Stack</h2>
<h4>C++</h4>
 This is where I have
the most professional exprerience. I have coded in modern C++14 style and C
with classes. The latter is popular in the embedded world. 
I prefer the modern approach if given the option.
<h4>JavaScript</h4>
For frontend I like JQuery. The 
advantage it gives over browser incompatability
is too good to pass up. I frequently have to support older IE versions.
I am really excitied about webcomponents.
I have professional experience using react.js and backbone. I also have done some work
using nodejs for fast prototyping.
<h4>Python</h4>
This website was created using Flask. Python is my preferred backend langauge.
The amount of libraries avaiable to a Python engineer is amazing. 
When speed is needed you can always use C++ or Cython.
<h4>SQL</h4>
I can write any query needed but ORMs are superior for most actions. If you try to change your database
and you are using straight SQL it becomes a nightmare quick. Of course some SELECT statements
are considerably easier when you can just write the SQL.
<h4>Linux</h4>
While at heart I am a developer I also have done some devops work.
I have knowledge of jenkins, apache, ansible and docker.
<h4>Others</h4>
I try to be language agnostic but choices have to be made.
I toy with other languages as well such as Go, Lisp, and Ruby. 
I am a fan of NoSQL but I haven't worked on a serious project that used it yet.
